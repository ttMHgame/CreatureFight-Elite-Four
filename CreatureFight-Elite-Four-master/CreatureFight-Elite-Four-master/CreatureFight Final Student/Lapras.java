 * TODO (152): Copy all code below public class Pikachu and paste it below.
 *          You will make a few changes to the code to make it appropriate for
 *          Lapras. These are listed in order from top to bottom:
 *              - Change the constructor to say Lapras instead of Pikachu
 *              - Lapras has 900 points of health
 *              - Lapras's type is Water
 *              - In the constructor, add a line at the end to set the transparency
 *                of the image of the health bar to 0
 *              - Show text that Lapras has fainted when its health bar's value is 
 *                less than or equal to 0
 *                  - When Lapras faints, you should be checking if getNewTwoCreature at 0
 *                    still has health first
 *                      - You should be switching to Creature 0 if this is the case
 *              - Lapras's second attack...
 *                  - if used against an fire type...
 *                      - Should do two times 100 points of damage (DON'T DO THE MATH! Write the math expression)
 *                      - Should display that the attack is super effective at a location of
 *                        half the width of the world and half the height of the world plus 26
 *                  - otherwise, if used against a rock type...
 *                      - Should do two times 100 points of damage (DON'T DO THE MATH! Write the math expression)
 *                      - Should display that the attack is super effective at a location of
 *                        half the width of the world and half the height of the world plus 26
 *                  - otherwise, if used against a grass type...
 *                      - Should do half of 100 points of damage (DON'T DO THE MATH! Write the math expression)
 *                      - Should display that the attack is not very effective at a location of
 *                        half the width of the world and half the height of the world plus 26
 *                      - Should delay the scenario by 30 act cycles
 *                  - otherwise...
 *                      - Should do 100 points of damage
 *              - In switchCreature...
 *                      - If idx is equal to 0...
 *                          - Change player two to Pikachu
 *
